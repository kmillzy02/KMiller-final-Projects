    <p> <b>Restraurant Description</b><br />
    <p>McDannos’s is a family-owned Italian restaurant.
        It was the baby of a retired detective from New Jersey 
        and his partner who grew up in Hawaii.<br /> Nestled in the 
        heart of downtown Honolulu, it is the only true Italian
        restaurant on the Island. Serving traditional Italian 
        cuisine who's recipes <br />come straight from Italy via 
        the owners grandmother, these dishes will have
        your mouth watering. Traditional Spaghetti and 
        lasagna are the top sellers<br /> here at McDanno’s. 
        The chef, who they moved here from Chicago, has
        brought his recipe for Pasta e Fagioli that will 
        have you getting gallons of soup to-go. </p>
